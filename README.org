* Novel Operating Systems Catalog
Catalogue of novel operating systems

Somewhere after the fall in popularity of note-taking apps, perhaps recognizing that just note-taking is not enough and the deafening hype of LLMs, there was a sweet period of lull when a lot of people started boldly building new operating systems. This is a catalogue of such operating systems that I have come across. In the past, before the commercialization of computers, we had a plethora of operating systems with unique languages to interact with computers, like AmigaOS, Symbolics, SunOS, MULTICS, Burroughs, Meneut, BeOS PARC, Star, Oberon, Plan9, NeXTSTEP, OS/2, PL/8, Inferno, QNX, RISCOS etc. This spirit can only be glimpsed in pockets, and kudos to all those who keep the fire alive!

Perhaps the best one to start off this catalog is the UXN/Varvara personal computing stack of [[https://100r.co][100 Rabbits]]. Such a great couple with such a radical vision!

They have documented their rationale in these two documents:

Something about Lisp draws people into construct OSes from ground up. Perhaps it is the simplicity of the language that acts as the foundation. Here‘s Interim, one of our favourite minimal OSes constructed with Lisp.
