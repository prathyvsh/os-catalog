# OS Catalog
Catalogue of novel operating systems

Somewhere after the fall in popularity of note-taking apps, perhaps recognizing that just note-taking is not enough and the deafening hype of LLMs, there was a sweet period of lull when a lot of people started boldly building new operating systems. This is a catalogue of such operating systems that I have come across. In the past, before the commercialization of computers, we had a plethora of operating systems with unique languages to interact with computers, like Symbolics, MULTICS, Burroughs, PARC, Star, Oberon, PLAN9, PL/8 etc. This spirit can only be glimpsed in pockets, and kudos to all those who keep the fire alive!

* UXN

Perhaps the best one to start off this catalog is the UXN/Varvara personal computing stack of [[https://100r.co][100 Rabbits]]. Such a great couple with such a radical vision!

# Playbit

Daring effort from Rasmus Anderson and team to rebuild computer from scratch.

# Nette.io

# Interim

Something about Lisp draws people into construct OSes from ground up. Perhaps it is the simplicity of the language that acts as the foundation.
